Minimisation of system 
 &cntrl
  imin=1,        ! Perform an energy minimization.
  maxcyc=4000,   ! The maximum number of cycles of minimization. 
  ncyc=2000,     ! The method will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient after NCYC cycles.
  restraint_wt = 10,          ! 10 kcal/mol/A**2 restraint force constant
  restraintmask = '!@H=&!:WAT' ! Restraints on the solute heavy atom
