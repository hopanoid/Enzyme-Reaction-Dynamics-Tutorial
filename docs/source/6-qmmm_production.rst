QM/MM Production Run
********************

Now we are ready to run our QM/MM production run. We will use the output from one of the short 200 fs run we had simulated using
QM4. Our aim is to run three *5 ps* independent QM/MM production runs. Here is the amber *mdin* :file:`tutorial/simulations/mdin/qmmm-tc-prod.in`

.. admonition:: A more flexible view of binding pose!.

        The binding pose of a ligand is often described by geomterical parameters like
        distances, angle/dihedrals etc. without giving any statistical significance 
        to the given values. Here, by running three independent simulations we are 
        aiming to compute the statistical significance for each of the geometrical
        parameters pertaining to the binding pose of our substrate. The computed standard
        deviations along with the average value ensure a more broader picture of active
        site. Results from these calculations are summarised in the table S1 and S2.

Here is the bash script that will automatically run these three independent simulations :file:`tutorial/simulations/3-amber-tc-prod.sh`

        #!/bin/bash

        dir="qm_log"
 
        if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                echo "Directory for storing QM log '$dir' created."
        else
                echo "Directory '$dir' already exists."
        fi

        for i in {1..3}
        do
                # Prefix for the input and output files
                ref=step6.4.4
                step=step7.prod.${i}

                # Sander production run
                sander -O -i mdin/qmmm-tc-prod.in -p xenA_h_OHP.parm7 -c ${ref}.rst7 -o ${step}.mdout -r ${step}.rst7 -inf ${step}.mdinfo -ref ${ref}.rst7 -x ${step}.nc &

                sleep 5s

                # Capturing QM log files at each step
                count=0
                
                # Whenever TeraChem completes its job, move the old log file to the qm_log directory
                while ! grep "Final Performance Info" ${step}.mdinfo > /dev/null; do
                if [[ -e old.tc_job.dat ]]; then

                mv old.tc_job.dat qm_log/${step}_tc_${count}.dat
                mv scr/charge_vdd.xls scr/${step}_charge_vdd_${count}.xls

                ((count=count+1))
                fi
                done

        done

Similar to previous one, this script will save and rename the *charge_vdd.xls* file at each step for each of the QM system. 
The trajectory files generated from these three 5 ps simulations, have been analysed to extract the key geometrical parameters 
of underlying binding pose of substrate.
