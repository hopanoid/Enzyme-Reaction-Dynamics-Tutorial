QM/MM Production Run
********************

Now we are ready to run our QM/MM prodcution run. We will use the output from one of the short 200 fs run, we had simulated using
QM4. Our aim was to run three *5 ps* independent QM/MM production runs. Here is the amber *mdin* :file:`tutorial/simulations/mdin/qmmm-tc-prod.in`

.. admonition:: Trick the Amber using its old ways!.

        Using Amber's QM/MM functionality, you can take advantage of using a QM package seprately,
        like if you want to compute a specific property related to QM region along with running a
        QM/MM MD simulation, specific atomic charges, dipole moment etc. And later on, the output
        from the QM package could be saved separately to analyse the respective property of
        choice. Amber will prepare the input file for chosen QM package on its own and will run the
        QM package using path specified in your machine. Each QM package will then run indepdently,
        while *sander* is in wait for their output. Once the QM package finished their job, *sander*
        reads the output and proceed for the next step. The new input file for the QM package will
        be prepared and the old input and output files then renamed with a prefix *old*. We are going
        to move these *old* files and will store them in a separate folder for later processing. There
        are also various other ways to automatise this, you can also modify the Amber QM/MM source code
        during installation , and then specific purpose Amber can be compiled using these modified scripts.  


Here is the bash script that will automatically run these three independent simulations :file:`tutorial/simulations/3-amber-tc-prod.sh`    

.. code-block::
        :emphasize-lines: 30,31
        :caption: QM/MM MD run using TeraChem_ as an external QM package

        #!/bin/bash

        dir="qm_log"
 
        if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
                mkdir -p "$dir"
                echo "Directory for storing QM log '$dir' created."
        else
                echo "Directory '$dir' already exists."
        fi

        for i in {1..3}
        do
                # Prefix for the input and output files
                ref=step6.4.4
                step=step7.prod.${i}

                # Sander production run
                sander -O -i mdin/qmmm-tc-prod.in -p xenA_h_OHP.parm7 -c ${ref}.rst7 -o ${step}.mdout -r ${step}.rst7 -inf ${step}.mdinfo -ref ${ref}.rst7 -x ${step}.nc &

                sleep 5s

                # Capturing QM log files at each step
                count=0
                
                # Whenever TeraChem completes its job, move the old log file to the qm_log directory
                while ! grep "Final Performance Info" ${step}.mdinfo > /dev/null; do
                if [[ -e old.tc_job.dat ]]; then

                mv old.tc_job.dat qm_log/${step}_tc_${count}.dat
                mv scr/charge_vdd.xls scr/${step}_charge_vdd_${count}.xls

                ((count=count+1))
                fi
                done

        done

Similar to previous one, this script will save and rename the *charge_vdd.xls* file at each step for each of the QM system. 
The trajectory files generated from these three 5 ps simulations, have been analysed to extract the key geometrical parameters 
of underlying binding pose of substrate. The summary of those parameters are presented in table S1.
