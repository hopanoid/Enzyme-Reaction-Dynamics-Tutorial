Parametrisation
---------------

.. important::

        Know your ligands and enzyme! This is very important before start following this or
        any other tutorials. Use any structural visualisation program like VMD, Pymol, Chimera,
        Maestro etc, to open input structural coordinate files. This will familarise you with 
        your input and will help you to track down any structural modelling deformity/error in
        subsequent processes. Especially, during force field (ff) parametrisation, where some programs
        guess bond order using supplied 3D coordinates and will assign ff parameter based on their 
        guess. Be careful at this point! Sometime a dobule bond might treated as single or vice-versa.

.. math::

        z(x) = \int_0^{\infty} f(x) dx
