Parametrisation

.. important::

        Know your ligands and enzyme! This is very important before start following this or
        any other tutorials. Use any structural visualisation program like VMD_, Pymol_, Chimera_,
        Maestro_ etc, to open input structural coordinate files. This will familarise you with 
        your input and will help you to track down any structural modelling deformity/error in
        subsequent processes. Especially, during force field (ff) parametrisation, where some programs
        guess bond order using supplied 3D coordinates and will assign ff parameter based on their 
        guess. Be careful at this point! Sometime a dobule bond might treated as single or vice-versa.

Splitting the PDB in protein, ligand and water molecules
========================================================


First, we will split the PDB in 3 different groups: protein, ligands and water molecules as we need to treat them separately:

.. code-block:: bash

   grep -v -e "FMH" -e "OHP" -e "CONECT" -e "HOH" 5xxx.pdb >  wt_protein.pdb
   grep "FMH" 5xxx.pdb > FMH.pdb
   grep "OHP" 5xxx.pdb > OHP.pdb
   grep "HOH" 5xxx.pdb > waters.pdb

Assessing the protonation states of the enzyme with careful attention for active site residues
==============================================================================================

There are several methods to assess the protonation state of the residues in a protein. Not limited to following:

        H++ Server

        The new release (version 4.0) of H++, uses AmberTools 20 to 
        preprocess a PDB file and it is able to generate AMBER
        compatible PDB structure.

.. warning::

        Histidines are tricky residues, they have three possible protonation states: HID, HIE and HIP. 
        HIP is the protonated residue. HID and HIE correspond to the two natural tautomers of the neutral 
        histidine, where the proton can be found in delta or epsilon positions. In solution, the most 
        common conformer is HIE but always visualise your structure before assuming any histidine protonation state.

        Here is an example showing the typical active site of Old Yellow Enzymes (OYE). XenA is a member of this class
        and after protonation, we found that protonation state of H178 predicted as HID, which is not correct, considering 
        the presence of substrate, the H178 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen.

        .. image:: /figs/XenA-oxH-prod.png

                :alt: Xenobiotic reductase A (XenA) complexed with Flavin and Oxime Colored (Green, Yellow and Red, respectively)


Last but not least, we need to clean the PDB file before passing it to AmberTools 
(removing residues with double ocupation, checking for disulfide bonds, â€¦). 
So we are going to use the first AmberTools tool: pdb4amber which prepares your PDB file.

.. code-block:: console
        :caption: Formating the protonated PDB file for further use

        pdb4amber -i protein.pdb -o protein4amber.pdb



How to select protonation state of a specific residue?
======================================================

We are using Ambertools to choose the desired protonation form of H178.
You can select the appropriate form of HIS by renaming HIS to HIE (proton on NE2), 
HID (proton on ND1), or HIP (both protons).

        :emphasize-lines: 4
        
        module load amber/20
        tleap -f leaprc.protein.ff14SB
        prot = loadpdb protein.pdb
        set {prot.177 prot.180} name "HID"
        savepdb prot wt_protein.pdb
        quit

.. code-block::
        :caption: Manipulating protonation state of a residue using VMD
        :emphasize-lines: 4

        mol new protein.pdb
        set prot [atomselect top "resid 177"]
        $prot set resname HIS
        set prot [atomselect top all]
        $prot writepdb wt_protein.pdb
        quit
