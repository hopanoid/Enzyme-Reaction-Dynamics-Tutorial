========================================
Selection of A Collective Variables (CV)  
========================================

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations are employed to explore potential structural variations along a pre-defined reaction coordinate or collective variable (CV). This technique is particularly useful for speeding up processes that might otherwise take a considerable amount of time to happen naturally. Subsequently, these generated configurations can serve two main purposes: they can shed light on the structural alterations relevant to the underlying reaction, and they can be employed to calculate free energy changes along the given CV. 

.. admonition:: How to choose starting value for a CV for SMD simulations?

        SMD simulations will steer your chosen CV from the defined initial position to the final postition.
        In our case, we know that the hyride will be transferred to N1 atom of the substrate from the N5 atom
        of the flavin cofactor. So, we know that steering of hydride should stop once it reached to its 
        destination N1 atom of the substrate. However, the difficult question is, what should be the starting
        distance of hydride ion from the N1 atom to start steering? In our last 5 ps QM/MM production runs,
        we found that hydride atom has variable distances from the N1 atom, and it would be difficult to guess
        the distance minima. There could be mutliple appraoches to handle this particular question, one should
        take the average of the distances b/w hydride and N1 atom obtained from the QM/MM simulations, or it 
        could be a plausible distance based on the existing studies where the distance between the hydride donor 
        and acceptor is well defined. We had no experience of comparing these appraoches, however, we believe that
        one should consider this question genuinely, as this could save significant amount of computation time for
        sampling the CV. We have chosen a different appraoch here, we ran a QM/MM scan along the N1-hydride distance
        using Qsite_ package (Gaussian_ can also be used). From the QM/MM scan, we found that the N1-hydride distance
        has an initial minimum around 2.0 Angstrom, hence we have chose 2.0 Angstrom our starting distance to steer 
        hydride atom from N5 atom to N1 atom.

                The 1D QM/MM scan along the distance b/w hydride receiver N1 atom and the hydride atom (H5) 

In the context of our work, we are examining a sequential reaction involving an initial hydride transfer followed by a proton transfer. Guided by our QM/MM scan, we've determined that the hydride transfer occurs first, necessitating that we focus on steering the system along the CV corresponding to hydride transfer before turning our attention to the proton transfer CV. Details concerning our chosen CVs are provided in supplementary figure S27. Here is the CV file for the hyride transfer CV to be used for running QM/MM SMD simulations :file:`tutorial/simulations/mdin/cv-hy-1.in`

The first highlighted line defines the atom numbers of the three atoms involved in hydride transfer. 11078 is substrates N1 atom, 11007 is the hyride ion, 10996 is the flavin's N5 atom. The hyride ion is being transferred from the N5 atom of the flavin to N1 atom of the substrate. The second highlighted line consist of the weightage factor for the respective distance, whereas the third highlighted line describe the starting and the end values of the handle position, respectively. The last highlighted line contains the value of spring constant.

Now, given the stochastic nature of molecular dynamics simulations, it is generally advised to run multiple SMD trajectories from different initial configurations to better sample the reaction coordinate. We have chosen mutliple starting configrations from our last three QM/MM production runs, where the hydride CV has a value of 2.0 Angstrom . The value of 2.0 Angstrom is based on the fact that the coordinate scan along the hyride transfer CV has shown minimum at this distance, hence we have chosen this as our starting point for steering. Using these randomly generated configrations as an input, we have an 75 independent QM/MM SMD simulations for hydride tranfer CV, followed by same number of simulations for proton transfer CV.

        Monitoring HOMO-LUMO Gap

        It has been reported for QM/MM simulations of proteins and other solvated molecules,
        that the HOMO-LUMO gap turned down to zero! This case should be avoided, hence we
        suggest to monitor the HOMO-LUMO gap for your chosen QM region. The corresponding 
        figure depicting the HOMO-LUMO gap for our QM regions is supplementary figure S25(b).  

Finally, we have analysed the total atomic charges of the substrate *vs* the six different QM regions. Please follow the supplementary figure S25(a), where you can see that the substrate's partial charge don't vary significantly from QM4 to QM6. Hence, we have selected the QM4 region as our choice for subsequent QM/MM simulations as follows.
