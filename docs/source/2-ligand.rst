Parameterizing Ligand
*********************

So far we have not paid attention to the ligand. We will now move to check the protonation state of the ligand.
We have to check the pKa of the ligand. There are several options to do so, the most reliable one if available
is PubChem, where you can find experimental pKa values.

In this example, there are no pKa values (neither experimental nor calculated) reported for this molecule, so we
need to use another resource. I like Marvin Sketch because it is free to use (you need to register and cannot
use it for comercial purposes), it gives calculated pKa values and it has a nice visualisation of the chemical
species at a different pH values.
