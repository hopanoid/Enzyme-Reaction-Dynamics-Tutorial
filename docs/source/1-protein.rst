Protein Parametrisation

.. important::

        Know your ligands and enzyme! This is very important before start following this or
        any other tutorials. Use any structural visualisation program like VMD_, Pymol_, Chimera_,
        Maestro_ etc, to open input structural coordinate files. This will familarise you with 
        your input and will help you to track down any structural modelling deformity/error in
        subsequent processes. Especially, during force field (ff) parametrisation, where some programs
        guess bond order using supplied 3D coordinates and will assign ff parameter based on their 
        guess. Be careful at this point! Sometime a dobule bond might treated as single or vice-versa.

Splitting the PDB in protein, ligand and water molecules
========================================================


First, we will split the PDB in 3 different groups: protein, ligands and water molecules as we need to treat them separately. OHP is the name of our oxime substrate, FMH is the flavin cofactor. Please pay attention to the PDB's Residue Name column (18-20) for the given name of the substrate therein. We have modified the name
of flavin cofactor and our oxime substrate. If you wanna do so, simply open the PDB file in any text editor and replace the exisiting name with a name of your choice (should be equal to or less than three characters). Be careful, don't shift the columns as this will destroy the inherent position of PDB's field-id. Anyway her
e are the bash commands to split input PDB files, to the respective protein and substrate files.

.. code-block:: bash

   grep -v -e "FMH" -e "OHP" -e "CONECT" -e "HOH" 8AU8.pdb >  protein.pdb
   grep "FMH" 8AU8.pdb > FMH.pdb
   grep "OHP" 8AU8.pdb > OHP.pdb
   grep "HOH" 8AU8.pdb > waters.pdb

Assessing the protonation states of the enzyme with careful attention for active site residues
==============================================================================================

There are several methods to assess the protonation state of the residues in a protein. Not limited to following:

        H++ Server

        The new release (version 4.0) of H++, uses AmberTools 20 to 
        preprocess a PDB file and it is able to generate AMBER
        compatible PDB structure.

                :alt: Protonation states of histidines

        Histidines are tricky residues, they have three possible protonation states: HID, HIE and HIP. 
        HIP is the protonated residue. HID and HIE correspond to the two natural tautomers of the neutral 
        histidine, where the proton can be found in delta or epsilon positions. In solution, the most 
        common conformer is HIE but always visualise your structure before assuming any histidine protonation state.

        Here is an example showing the typical active site of Old Yellow Enzymes (OYE). The enzyme displayed here is XenA (an ene-reductase belongs to Old Yellow Enzyme 3)
        and after protonation, we found that protonation state of H178 predicted as HID, which is not correct, considering the presence of substrate, instead the NE atom of the H178 should have been protonated to form the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. Similarly, the ND atom of the H181 should be protonated instead of NE. Here, is the active site with correct protonation of H178 and H181.

Last but not least, we need to clean the PDB file before passing it to AmberTools 
(removing residues with double ocupation, checking for disulfide bonds, â€¦). 
So we are going to use the first AmberTools tool: pdb4amber which prepares your PDB file.

.. code-block:: console
        :caption: Formating the protonated PDB file for further use

        pdb4amber -i protein.pdb -o protein4amber.pdb



How to select protonation state of a specific residue?
======================================================

We are using Ambertools to choose the desired protonation form of H178.
You can select the appropriate form of HIS by renaming HIS to HIE (proton on NE2), 
HID (proton on ND1), or HIP (both protons). By this way amber will add the required missing atoms
for the specified mutation, but be careful here, for example if you wanna mutate Lysine to Glutamic
Acid, first delete the sidechain atoms of the Lysine residue from the PDB file, then use the below
command, amber will then add the coordinates of missing atoms for the Glutamic acid residue. In short 
trick is to retain the backbone atoms before any substituion!!
