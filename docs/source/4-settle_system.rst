*****************
Settle the System
*****************

===================================================
Removing bad atomic contacts and minimizing vaccum!
===================================================

We have just modelled a "matured" system, means we have placed all required molecules in a box. This step-wise placement could lead 
to overlapping atomic positions or very close atomic contacts or very far atomic postions, this could results in atomic replusion or
can forbidden possible atomic interactions too. To minimize these positional artifacts energy minimisation is a 
crucial step before proceeding further. Essentially, we are going to use the potential energy terms derived from the force-field, 
that will use the 3D coordinate as input and will try to optimise the positions of atoms, so that any clashes or
vaccum therein will be minimsed.

Breifly, the system will undergo sequentially through steps:

1. Classical Energy Minimization
        * Will try to optimize the psotion of atoms using the supplied molecular mechanics parameters e.g. bond-length, angle, van-der-waal etc

        imin=1,        ! Perform an energy minimization.
        maxcyc=4000,   ! The maximum number of cycles of minimization.
        ncyc=2000,     ! The method will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient after NCYC cycles.
        ntr=1,         ! Enabling restraints
        restraint_wt = 10,          ! 10 kcal/mol/A**2 restraint force constant
        restraintmask = '!@H=&!:WAT,Na+' ! Restraints on the solute heavy atom
         /
        
We are aiming to preserve the heavy atom positions, for this we are using a small restraint (10 kcal/mol/A^2) on the protein's heavy atom. You can commentout the highlighted lines (just add ! in the begining) if you wanna minimise all atoms.       
                
2. Thermalisation
        * Kinetic energy or say the dynamics of the atoms increased step-wise

        &wt type='END' /
        
Its a 30 ps NVT equilibration where the temperature has been linearly increased from 0 to 298K from begining to 20 ps and for the rest of 10 ps, temperature will remain constant at 298K. Let's see if this is true or not!

This is a usual NPT run for 100 ps. Just to allow the solvent and hydrogen atoms to explore their neighbourhood.

We have used a script to automtise the above step. If you are following these steps for the first time, do not run this script blindly. Be aware that it depends on the system to system, how much and which equilibration you need. Especially for a completely user-build system, unlike a crystal structure you need extra equiliration time.
