**************************************
NBO Coupled with QM/MM SMD Simulations
**************************************

Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis is based on the classical lewis dots structure, where the octet rule has been used to explain the valency of an atom. 
Basically, the electrons are being divided into core and valence group, later on the energy of the atomic and natural orbitals computed based on their occupancy.
Coupling NBO analysis with SMD simulations will help us to visualise the electronic transition among the molecular orbitals along the reaction coordinate. NBO_ is
a licenced software and you need to have it in your path while running it, a QM package will write an input file for NBO_ on its own (with extension .47), this
input file then passed on to NBO_ binaries and the respective output from the NBO_ will be captured back by a QM package. To run NBO_ at each step of our QM/MM SMD
simulation, we need to mention this in the template file for TeraChem_ , here is the template file for TeraChem_ to generate NBO_ input :file:`tutorial/simulations/nbo/tc_job.tpl` 

.. code-block::

        end

The first highlighted line directs the TeraChem_ to use advanced NBO_ functionality, where we can also specify the NBO_ keywords to be written
in the NBO_ input file. The *ARCHIVE* keyword will save NBO_ input file *OHPORB.47* at each step, and later on we will store this file at a 
specific location. There are no changes needed in the amber *mdin* file for running NBO_ alongwith QM/MM SMD, it will remains same as before :file:`tutorial/simulations/nbo/mdin/qmmm-smd-hy-1.in`

There are minor changes in the bash script to run NBO_ alongwith the QM/MM SMD, the required changes are highlighted below. Here is the content of the automated script :file:`tutorial/simulations/nbo/5-amber-tc-nbo-smd-hy-1.sh`

The highlighted line direct the shell to rename and relocate the NBO_ input file at each step of the QM/MM SMD run. Later on, you can use these saved *.47* files
as an input for NBO program to generate the corresponding orbital information along the CV. These *.47* files are written by TeraChem_, having the wavefunction and coordinate information. Header of the *.47* is like:

.. code-block:: console
        
         $GENNBO  NATOMS=113  NBAS=993  UPPER  BODM  FORMAT  $END

You can customise the second line with the desired flags for processing the NBO_ input files. For more info on using NBO_ and its output, please visit https://nbo6.chem.wisc.edu/tutor_css.htm
